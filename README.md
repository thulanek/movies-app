# AWESOME MOVIES APP

This project was built using React JS. I pulled for TypeScript instead of JavaScript for all the advantages that static typing bring but that I kept it as vanilla as possible to make it easy for you to traverse.

## Project Pages
This project has a total of 5 pages.
- Homepage
- Popular Movies Page
- About Me Page
- Movie Detail Page
- Favourites Page

Each pages renders the specified components listed in the Assessment document, with the additional functionality of favouriting movies one likes most and those movies being persisted in the browser through local storage.

### API's, libraries and frameworks
1. The inbuilt Context API is used for state management. 
2. `react-hook-form` is used to handle form inputs and form validation specifically for the Trello Form.
3. `react-router-dom` is used to handle routing, linking and redirecting across the site.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn test`

Runs unit tests, testing the NoListContent.tsx component in /src/components and the getRatingsColour helper function in src/utils asserting that they functions as expected.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
